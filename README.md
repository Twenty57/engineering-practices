## Terminology

There is some terminology used in some of these documents, which
we clarify here:

*   **PR**: Stands for "pull-request", which means one self-contained change that
    has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
    Other organizations might call this a "change", "patch", or "changelist".
*   **LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me". It is what a code reviewer says when
    approving a PR.

## Accreditation

Some of these documents are based on [Google's engineering practices](https://github.com/google/eng-practices). We've revised their ideas and practices to fit our low-code environment. Thanks Google!
